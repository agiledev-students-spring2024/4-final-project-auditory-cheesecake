# Build and launch the back end

1. Navigate into the `back-end` directory from the main project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
3. Then, while still in the root of the `back-end` directory, create a .env file. In this .env file, set `USE_MOCK_DATA=true`. This will ensure that when you build the back-end, you will use mock data until more features are released.
4. Run `npm start` to launch the back-end server.
